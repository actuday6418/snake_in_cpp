# snake_in_cpp
Not complete. I just need to get this off my disk. I intened to make a snake game and then take it forward to become a very easy to use and simple platform game maker. 

# USAGE
1. Install SFML using apt install libsfml-dev, for Ubuntu based Distros, and build essential too, for g++.
2. Compile by running the bash script compile.sh and use the run argument for launching the app after the build.(sh compile.sh run)
